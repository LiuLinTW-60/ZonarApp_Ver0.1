    <string name="introduction">The core DSP technology invented by Embrace Audio Lab, redefines the sound experience. With XROUND, any stereo sound source can be automatically transformed into a multi-channel home theater device.
This process which traditionally requires complicated setups of up to 6 speakers or more. The XROUND algorithm analyzes and reconstructs sound waves in real time, providing the best performance in millisecond with just two speakers.</string>
